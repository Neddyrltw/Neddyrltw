## Hi there 👋



- 🔭 I’m currently working on jumping back in to a simple app I am creating for home use that I paused in order to gain much-needed experience with other languages and frameworks.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about non-relational databases and how to effectively index and query large datasets quickly and efficiently.
- 
- 👯 I was working on a team project for DTC sales with a robust backend and cimpliance checks using Saleor, Django, Python, TypeScript. The repo can be found here:
    -   https://github.com/vyne-app
    -   I learned a lot about AWS deployment, GraphQL/PostgreSQL, front-end optimization.
